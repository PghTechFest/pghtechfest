						            <p data-bind="html: description" class="full_descr">After almost 20 years in building software, I came to have “engineer” in my title for the first time, and I wondered at the significance of this. When you think of traditionally “well-engineered” things, their entire experience, from start to finish, is controlled.<br>
				 <br>
				After focusing primarily on the fundamentals of “good” software development (Craftsmanship, TDD, Agile, etc.) throughout my career, I now thought that it was time to step back and look at building something with a holistic viewpoint.<br>
				 <br>
				If you think of all the great customer experiences, from cars to retail to software, they are all engineered from one point of view on the outside: a person.<br>
				 <br>
				How does this car drive? What kind of people buy this car? What kind of maintenance should we expect? Where do we go for help when there is a problem? These facets of a product are engineered towards a single perception, but they don’t get there by a magical P.R. machine alone.<br>
				 <br>
				So while code quality, tests and being agile all matter, let’s step out to the macro level and talk about the little things that can make or break a great project. Let’s think of things that matter to a user, to a build team, and to the stakeholders in the business themselves, and let’s make sure their experience is exceptional.<br>
				 <br>
				At the end of the day, whether its setting expectations about delivery times, advocating a certain technology be used by the development team or the simple act of controlling input on a Web form, it all boils down to getting a desired output from different inputs - it’s all about engineering a personal experience.</p>

In the past few years though, that barrier has all but disappeared with the creation of platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Lego Mindstorms and I have finally started realizing my childhood dreams (although the full Terminator is still in production).<br>
				<br>
				At the same time I was getting back into robotics, I was also getting deep into Ruby. And as much as I love rehashing my old college days of hacking C, I wanted to marry these two paths, and thus I went down the path of hacking my bots with Ruby.<br>
				<br>
				In this talk, I want to share what I have learned along the way. We will be covering how to use Ruby to program robots across the spectrum. We will start with "pre-fab" robots like Sphero, move onto Lego Mindstorms, and then finally head to the DIY bots built on Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. We'll cover the tools you need, as well as some tips and tricks to get you up and hacking quickly. Finally we will explore how this approach works in some bots I have built.</p>

						            <p data-bind="html: description" class="full_descr">Agile methodologies have a strong role for the product owner; however, most organizations struggle to identify the differences and similarities of the product owner and the product manager. Questions around the need for both or even need for product management as a practice come up. Product managers should not be hiding in the corner office, but actively engaged daily with development team.<br>
				<br>
				In my session, I will introduce best practices on how to leverage product management within agile to build market driven product lines. I will give tips and tricks on what product managers need to do to better align with Agile and how development can better educate product management on their needs. Highlights of session include:<br>
				<br>
				    Definition of product managements’ role in the organization<br>
				<br>
				    Leveraging a design partner for new product introductions<br>
				<br>
				    Demands every development team should be making of product management<br>
				<br>
				    Pit falls to avoid in building strong product management and developer relations</p>

The increase in computing power, but more importantly its availability to average people has spurred the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) behind modern interfaces. In this talk the basic NLP components backing common problems such as sentiment analysis and full-text search will be explored using tools available to typical, modern web developers -- not stuffy university-types. While the code/tools presented will be in python and node.js the underlying algorithms are agnostic to language, even those obscure ones you've probably never hear of.</p>

One of the most important factors in successful Microsoft Azure solutions is a well-conceived plan for application insights. In this session we will pull back the covers on Azure diagnostics.  We will take a look at how the diagnostics agent works, and how to best configure it to get the data we need.  We will also explore techniques for monitoring our Azure applications in production.  With the proper application instrumentation and telemetry we can gain invaluable data for troubleshooting, and preventing, problems with our solutions hosted in Azure</p>

						            <p data-bind="html: description" class="full_descr">Even though DDI is in the business of talent management and leadership development, we—like most organizations—struggled to make the transition to Agile from Waterfall. It took us two years of often slow, inconsistent and unpredictable development cycles to realize that our teams weren’t fully empowered to make decisions and didn’t feel responsible for the outcomes.<br>
				So despite sound product strategy, quality people and strong technical training, our success in transitioning to Agile all hinged on one thing: adapting our people processes to drive a culture of empowerment within both our leaders and teams within the new Agile environment.<br>
				Come learn how DDI improved software development speed, quality, predictability and sustainability by:<br>
				• Altering our existing team member and formal/informal leadership competency models to better reflect Agile principles.<br>
				• Determining how to best place people in the teams and roles that would ensure their and the organizations’ success.<br>
				<br>
				• Adapting our hiring and development processes to bring in and grow people more capable of driving a culture of trust and accountability.</p>

Many languages have non-deterministic constructs and notations that may lead to unsafe and unsecure code. The talk will present some well-known safety or security errors/issues caused by syntax or semantics code errors. Then, we will present existing approaches and standards to tackle such issues and how to practically use them (with static analysis tools, compiler options, etc.) in order to improve quality of your code.<br>
				<br>
				The talk will try to maintain a relation with existing code and projects to show the impact of a code defect in terms of security (e.g. the iPhone goto error) or safety (e.g. Ariane 5 rocket that exploded at launch)</p>

						            <p data-bind="html: description" class="full_descr">Vagrant makes standing up a local web development environment super simple. All you, as a developer, has to know is to checkout a repo and type “vagrant up” to get your local server built. It creates the server from the config saved in the repo. All of the packages are install and it maps to the your local drive so that you can start hacking in minutes. This eliminate the “it works on my machine” excuse, but it also eliminates the need to manage development servers. Those resources can be reserved for CI and pre-production testing. While this is all great, there is a lot more you can do with that simple “vagrant up” command. You probably have your code modules that need built. Databases to populate. And you’ll need to start your app. Web front-ends are as simple as they used to be, so you’ll also have to run CSS pre-processing, JS bundling, and other front-end build tasks. Tying all of this into “vagrant up” makes starting and working on your app a breeze. I’ll walk through how we setup a node.js app that does just that. I’ll cover the tools we used -- Puppet and Gulp among others -- and how they work in a Vagrant setup. I’ll touch on some common pitfalls in this setup and how it affects our production process.</p>

				With the rise of Data Science, statistics and Machine Learning have become valued tools in the field of software development. Now, more than ever, a fundamental understanding of Machine Learning and its place in software systems has become necessary for ambitious developers. With my academic research background in applied machine learning and years of industry experience developing large software systems, I strive to bring the power of Machine Learning to software developers everywhere, allowing them to leverage powerful new data-driven features in their projects.<br>
				<br>
				In this talk, I’ll walk you through the fundamental concepts, use cases, and tools of machine learning for modern software development. We’ll cover classification, clustering, and other common machine learning techniques, and work with hands-on examples using Scikit-learn, a powerful Python machine learning library with unsurpassed usability. Afraid of advanced math? Fear not! I’ll focus on approachable concepts, tools, and techniques that you can start using today in your own projects.</p>

Take heart, I am not here to disparage your approach to building websites, just to bring clarity and purpose through an approach that favors common sense over conventional wisdom. We’ll explore how using a content structure map of essential, useful, and peripheral elements helps set a path for a better user experience. We’ll also look at how mobile wire framing and graphic design results in a cleaner, clearer desktop experience and helps avoid the gotchas that plague responsive design work during the build. Bring your own stories and lessons for a spirited discussion. At least one member of the audience will receive a copy of Luke Wroblewski’s Mobile First and templates for content structure maps and mobile wire frames will be shared with all.</p>

				The Scala language will be used the vehicle for this demonstration, but the techniques apply immediately to any industrial-strength statically typed language, such as Haskell, OCaml, F#, Rust.<br>

						            <p data-bind="html: description" class="full_descr">As companies introduce agile practices, the Business Analyst role is often left by the wayside. The title does not even exist in Scrum or other specific agile implementations, leaving many Business Analysts wondering where they fit in. But fear not! The skills of a good BA are even more valuable in an agile environment! Diane Zajac-Woodie tells the tale of a new agile team, struggling with no formal training, a resistant corporate culture and unwilling team members. She shares how this team benefited from the communication, collaboration and facilitation skills of an experienced BA.<br>
				<br>
				She goes on to highlight some specific shifts that Business Analysts can make in order to help their own team’s transition. These include using story maps and writing executable requirements, just in time. Embracing their new roles, BAs can also encourage team members to cross role boundaries. This leads to new skill acquisition and a more cohesive team, which ultimately leads to higher quality software.</p>
